                                If you are a provider who offers Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services, you may have encountered some difficulties when submitting claims to Optum. One of the common reasons for claim denial is that the provider is not eligible for the services they provided. This can happen if the provider is not contracted with Optum for EAP, or if they are contracted for a different EAP product than the one they billed for.</p>

                            <p class="insurance-details__text-1">To avoid this issue, you need to make sure that you are using the correct modifier when submitting your claims. The modifier HJ indicates that the service is an EAP service, and it should be appended to the CPT code on the claim form. For example, if you provided a 60-minute individual counseling session, you would use the code 90837 HJ. This will help Optum identify your claim as an EAP claim and process it accordingly.</p>

                            <p class="insurance-details__text-1 mt-2">If you have already submitted a claim without the HJ modifier and it was denied, you can resubmit it with the correct modifier within the timely filing limit. You can also contact Optum's Provider Services at 1-800-888-2998 for assistance with your claim issues.</p>

                            <p class="insurance-details__text-1 mt-2">We hope this information helps you understand how to submit your EAP claims to Optum and avoid unnecessary denials.
